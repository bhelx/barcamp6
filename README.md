## Setup

This project uses the latest node 0.10.13.

### OS X

We recommend you use this exact version. If you don't have node already all you have to do is run:

```bash
brew install node
```

If you are not sure what homebrew is. [See more information here](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/).

If you already have a node version installed, we recommend you uninstall it and install the latest or you can use something like [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage multiple node versions.

If you choose to use nvm, just install node with:

```bash
nvm install 0.10.13
```

We'd also recommend you make the new node your default just in case it slips back but this step is optional if you know what you are doing:

```bash
nvm alias deafult 0.10.13
```
